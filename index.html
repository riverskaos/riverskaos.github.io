<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>An Identity Crisis</h3>

<p>	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I find it pertinent to first define  the word your eyes immediately were drawn to: crisis – &lsquo;a time when a difficult  or important decision must be made&rsquo;. I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. And the  answer is yes, I am overdramatic most days, but if I weren&rsquo;t then why would you  be here reading what I seem to have no courage to say aloud? I found that upon  arriving to college, I indeed found myself in an identity crisis. I had to  decide how I wanted to represent my body, what sort of style did I want to  exhibit; would I be a pious Christian or one of those slightly wild, but still  safe kinds of people? You get the idea, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve been there before. <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But there was a more intense,  pressing matter that continually weighed on my brain. What was I going to call  myself? This was my chance to remake myself if I so chose. I suppose you must  also understand that I introduce myself by my middle name, forever hiding my  first name. During my childhood, first names were sort of a family secret, but  that&rsquo;s for another time.<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I repeatedly found myself caught between the  studious and attentive &lsquo;Melissa&rsquo; during class (I liked to think she was the  sophisticated type), and the friendly and quite (uncharacteristically)  out-going &lsquo;Ashley&rsquo; among my peers. And so I can only conclude that at this very  point in time, sitting in this chair, I am a strange amalgamation of the two  personalities. So hello, I would like to introduce myself. I am currently  calling myself Melissa Ashley for the time being and I would like to cordially  invite you to take a gander.</p>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
